## Problem statement ?

Bajaj Financial Securities Limited (BFSL) is a 100% subsidiary of Bajaj Finance Limited (BFL). BFSL is heavily leveraging technology to create a unique and real-time trading experience for its customers and partners. BFSL trade applications (Mobile and Web) has a Watchlist feature to track scrips changing prices during market hours. Currently we show only +/- percent(%) change in prices. We want to include chart images along with current prices against each scrip.

## Our solution -

Our application employs a real-time rendering approach to display chart snapshots fetched from our repository. By doing so, we optimize bandwidth usage and minimize internet data consumption for our users, eliminating the need to download large image files.

One of the key features of our app is the Comprehensive Watchlist Chart, which offers users a comprehensive view of their selected stocks or assets' performance over the past three months. This holistic overview allows users to gain valuable insights into the historical trends and patterns of their investments, aiding in making informed decisions.

Moreover, our app provides invaluable assistance in designing an effective investing portfolio. By analyzing past data, the application identifies top gainers and losers, enabling users to make data-driven choices while constructing their investment portfolios. This ensures that users are well-equipped to maximize their investment potential and achieve their financial goals.

With our user-friendly interface and powerful analytical tools, users can confidently navigate the complexities of the financial markets. Whether users are seasoned investors seeking to refine their strategies or newcomers looking to embark on their investment journey, our app is designed to cater to their diverse needs and guide them towards success.

Emphasizing the importance of data accuracy and reliability, we have incorporated trusted data sources and continuously update our information to provide the most up-to-date insights. Our dedication to delivering a seamless user experience is evident through the thoughtful implementation of features, providing users with an intuitive and rewarding journey within the realm of investing.

In summary, our application offers real-time rendering of chart snapshots, presents a comprehensive watchlist chart, and assists users in creating an effective investing portfolio through the analysis of past data. By combining advanced technology with user-oriented design, we empower our users to make well-informed investment decisions and pursue financial prosperity with confidence.


## Working of our solution -

Our solution, called "InsightInvest," is a user-friendly mobile application designed to provide real-time stock market data and analysis to its users. The app's workflow begins with a splash screen that appears when the user opens the application. Upon completion of the authentication process, the user is directed to a sign-in screen where they can input their details, following the standard procedure seen in many other applications.

Once authenticated, the user is led to the home screen, which displays the current date and a profile bar. Additionally, the home screen showcases the most active stocks of the current day up to that specific time. To offer a comprehensive perspective on stock performance, the app includes a section named "Today's Performance," listing the stocks that have shown the best performance up to that particular time. This approach recognizes that the most active stocks might not necessarily be the best-performing ones on a given day.

The bottom section of the app comprises two more screens, bringing the total to three, including the home screen. The second screen is dedicated to displaying "All Stocks," providing users with a wide variety of choices without any restrictions. This unrestricted selection allows users to explore various stocks actively listed in the market. The third screen is the "Watchlist," where users can personalize their investments and interests by listing specific stocks. Clicking on any stock in the watchlist provides the user with live data for that particular stock. In case the market is closed, a straight line is displayed. Users can also zoom in on charts for a better look.

The server-side of the application gets activated once the authentication process is completed successfully. The server's API fetches real-time stock market data, converts it into charts or graphs, and then converts these visuals into strings using image base64 format. This conversion is done to optimize processing speed and response time, ensuring smooth user experience.

On the backend, the data is processed, and the components include time, script name (stock name), and prices. The information gathered is utilized to update the graph screen in the watchlist section, showcasing historical data. Simultaneously, the real-time data screen keeps updating according to the standard stock update frequency, typically aligning with actual market hours. The constant flow of data is achieved through the interaction and integration of feedings and plugins between the backend and server.

In conclusion, InsightInvest is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use stock market application that delivers real-time data, insightful graphs, and personalized watchlists to empower users with valuable information for their investments. The seamless interplay between the frontend and backend ensures a smooth and dynamic user experience, making InsightInvest an essential tool for stock market enthusiasts and investors.
